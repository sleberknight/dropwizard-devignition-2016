# Dropwizard sample code for DevIgnition 2016

This repository contains three sample Dropwizard applications that accompany a presentation on Dropwizard given at the  DevIgnition conference (http://www.devignition.com/) on April 29, 2016.

It is organized as a multi-module Maven repository with the following three modules:

* devignition-service: A sample app for creating and listing speakers at the DevIgnition conference
* nest-service: Sample app simulating control for Nest thermostats
* alexa-service: Sample app that pretends to act like Alexa (from Amazon Echo) and can control Nest thermostats by making calls to the Nest service
